## Answers examples

### Tell me about yourself

>*“Before I got into digital marketing, I worked in insurance for a long time. At the time, I was doing some volunteer social media marketing for my local homeless shelter, and I thought, ‘I really like this!’ I’m definitely a go-getter and someone who likes to take initiative, so when I finally realized I was unhappy in insurance, I decided to make a change, and I was lucky enough to land a job at an advertising agency.  Now, after ten years there, I’ve realized that I’m ready for a more challenging role in leadership.”*


### What motivates you?

>*“I have always been motivated by any situation in which I have to build a project team and meet project deadlines. I have a passion for identifying the strengths of different team members and helping them build their own skillset during a project. Last year, for example, half of my team members had never participated in a fundraising campaign, but I knew they could handle it. After we finished the project, two of the team members said they love fundraising now, and they thanked me for trusting them to be part of the project.”*


### Where do you see yourself in five years?

>*“In 5 years, I hope to sharpen my skills in two specific areas of teaching: technology in the elementary classroom and social-emotional learning. I would especially love to become an expert in using technology as a literacy tool. In terms of social-emotional learning, I hope to become much more educated in ways that I can use it to create a more inclusive learning environment for elementary school children.”*


### Can you tell me about a time when you had a conflict with someone on your team?

>*“I was working with a designer on an email campaign for a new client. There were a few occasions when I asked her to email me something the day before a weekly creative meeting, and she would forget or send it too late. Later, she would apologize. I gave her some feedback about this issue, but I think I hurt her feelings, and she felt I overstepped my role as a copywriter. So I apologized; I asked her if there was a better way I could have addressed the issue and could communicate better in the future. We decided that the best solution was to have a short meeting before the creative meeting every week, and that fixed our problem.*


- Can you give me an example of a time when you failed to meet a specific goal?

>*“When I was doing freelance web development, one of my clients was a cello teacher who gave lessons online. He wanted me to help him launch a new website and online course in six months, and although I had never worked on that kind of timeline, I thought it would be possible. I thought if I worked really hard, we could do it on our own, and I wouldn’t need to ask for any temporary help. Unfortunately, we failed to meet the six-month deadline. It took us closer to nine months. My client was understanding, but now I see that I would have met this goal if I had been more aware of the short timeline or the need for help.”*




- Can you tell me about a long-term project that you managed and how you managed it?

>*“I used to do some volunteer outreach for the soup kitchen at my church. Our pastor wanted to open up another location in another part of town, and he asked me if I was interested in helping him with that project. So, I started sending out emails, making announcements, and reaching out to other church members interested in helping and donating. Once we had enough interest, I formed and led a small task group. Then, we started fundraising, working with a real estate agent, and reaching out to donors. It took us about 18 months, but we were eventually able to open another soup kitchen location with a lot of support from the community.”* 



- What would you do if…?

>*“It might depend on the meeting and how familiar I am with how the manager does things. If I’m unfamiliar with his style, I might ask my manager how he likes to structure his meetings.  I would also ask the manager a few questions, like the main points he needs to cover in the meeting, the tasks he needs to follow up on from the team, and the action items he expects after the meeting. I would be as communicative as possible with him before and after the meeting so that he wouldn’t feel the need to follow up with the other attendees.”*



- How would you describe your ideal boss or manager?

>*“My ideal manager would be someone who understands how to lead both a team and an individual. They can identify the strengths and weaknesses of team members, and they are interested in helping everyone grow and develop in their professional life. They are an excellent communicator in meetings, and they give clear and specific feedback. They also ask for regular feedback from others.”*



- Why shouldn’t we hire you?

>*“You shouldn’t hire me if socialization is a big part of this job. I’m an introvert, and I also really value my personal life and time away from work. I enjoy working with others and collaborating; I like being friendly with my coworkers, but I don’t think I would be a good fit if part of the company culture is to socialize a lot after work hours or even during work hours.”*



- How much were you making at your last job?




## Grammar structures

- Where do you see yourself in five years?
GRAMMAR HINT: Did you notice which grammar structures would be useful here? 

You can use the present simple to discuss general facts about yourself, like your passions, interests, or motivations. 

You can use the past simple to share work experiences and anecdotes that happened within a finished time period (such as Last year, in 2015, when I was younger, etc.).

Use the present perfect when you talk about work experiences without mentioning a specific time.

And, if you need to review how to use certain prepositions, you should check out this post.
